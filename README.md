## 🧠 Project Overview

This project uses a **Linear Regression model** to predict student marks based on the number of hours studied.

The goal of this project was to:
- Understand ML model training
- Learn Flask backend development
- Practice Docker containerization
- Deploy a production-ready application on cloud

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Python
- Flask
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Gunicorn
- Docker
- Render (Cloud Deployment)

---

## 📊 Machine Learning Model

- Algorithm: Linear Regression
- Training Data: Sample dataset of study hours vs marks
- Model saved using: Pickle (.pkl file)

---

## 🐳 Docker Setup

The application is containerized using Docker for consistent deployment.

Build image:Run container: docker run-p 5000:5000 student-app
